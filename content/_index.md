Welcome to my notes site!

# Peter who?

Hey! Welcome to yet another site of mine. My name is Petr Ger≈°l and I am a high school student, based in Brno, Czech Republic. This is a site dedicated to my notes. Enjoy!

# Why this site exists?

In a project started in the summer of 2023, I redesigned my personal website. For easier navigation in everything I put out and to learn more about basic front-end development, I decided to separate everything into 3 websites:

- [portfolio, blog and gallery](https://pgersl.xyz/)
- [my music](https://music.pgersl.xyz/)
- and [my notes](#)

The primary reason why I wrote this website is to share my notes with my classmates and, since these are online, with the entire world. I used to use [Notion](https://www.notion.so/), [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and even [Roam Research](https://roamresearch.com/) to take notes. While these platforms are awesome for personal note-taking, it is either painful or pricy to share my notes with people around me, even harder with those who don't usually deal with plain-text markdown files. This is why I decided (after [my friend](https://vitcerny.xyz/) did it) to just do everything on my own and create a website. This eventually turned into several websites.

# What can you find here?

This is a website containing all my notes on various topics including a whole lot of notes from school. These notes are primarily written in Czech (the majority of them are) and only a few are in English. The site does not offer multilingual support (yet).

**So don't just sit there! Start exploring, maybe you'll learn something!**
